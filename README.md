# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Introduction

This is a sorting algorithm visualizer written in Python using the Pygame library. It allows you to visualize various sorting algorithms in action.

## Installation

To run the visualizer, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Python installed. You can download it from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you cloned or downloaded the repository.

4. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

5. Run the visualizer by executing the following command:

    ```
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

Once you have the visualizer running, you can use the following key functions:

- Randomization Patterns:
  - Press 1 to generate a random array.
  - Press 2 to generate a reversed array.
  - Press 3 to generate a pyramid pattern.
  - Press 4 to generate an inverted pyramid pattern.
  - Press 5 to generate an array with mostly the same elements.
  - Press 6 to generate an almost sorted array.

- Sorting Algorithms:
  - Press Q to select Bubble Sort.
  - Press W to select Insertion Sort.
  - Press E to select Selection Sort.
  - Press R to select Merge Sort.
  - Press T to select Quick Sort.
  - Press Y to select Bogo Sort.

- Other Functions:
  - Press SPACE to start or stop the sorting process.

## Features

The visualizer offers the following features:

1. Simple and interactive GUI.
2. Fast and accurate sorting algorithms.
3. Efficient data storage.
